# GeneLinkedList

This project implements DNA, chromosome, and gene structures using linked lists in C++. The program performs operations such as:
    - Crossover: Combines parts of two chromosomes to create new ones.
    - Mutation: Changes the value of a specific gene to X.
    - Custom Print: Traverses the linked list and displays the smallest value in each chromosome.
The program ensures proper memory management by using destructor functions for DNA, chromosome, and gene objects.
